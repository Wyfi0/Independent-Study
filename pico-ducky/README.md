# Duckyscript!
## I don't care to learn it well, 
### But I'll mess around

A "BadUSB" is a little microcontroller that acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) like a keyboard or mouse, or both! 
They are often disguised as a simple flash drive but once plugged in, they run their program. 
These programs are written in duckyscript, a very simple garbage language.

Here I'll keep any duckyscripts I write!
