# Yoooooo Bash
## Here are my bash scripts and some little explainations behind them


### mountsrv.sh 
This is barely a script (more of a shortcut) but it's still useful for me. All it does is mount my nfs server to a mount point on my laptop.
I put this in my /bin so I can call it from anywhere!

### wallpaper.sh 
This is a bigger script that I'll use to configure and loop through a few wallpapers and maybe a few depending on time of day.
