# Yoooooo Bash
## Here are my bash scripts and some little explainations behind them


### mountsrv.sh 
This is barely a script (more of a shortcut) but it's still useful for me. All it does is mount my nfs server to a mount point on my laptop.
Eventually I'll put this in my /bin so I can call it from anywhere!
